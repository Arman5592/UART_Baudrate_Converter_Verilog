# UART_Baudrate_Converter_Verilog

** Work In Progress **
I intend to create a simple UART Baudrate converter using a FIFO, and synthesize it on an FPGA. 
The aim is to convert bursts of data from a high baudrate into lower baudrates, or to convert 
lower baudrates into higher baudrates with an added latency.
